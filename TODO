# TODO
# implement missing mission types
# implement mission rerolls (one button at the side of each missionButton)
# give ATM with 1% chance when completing a hard mission
# implement chat messages for the player that was rewarded with the mission and reward gotten (broadcast if mission difficulty is hard)
# show Reward Range in mission button tooltip
# fix KillMission, and also render the spawn egg item instead of the entity. If there is no spawn egg of said entity, just render a some default one
